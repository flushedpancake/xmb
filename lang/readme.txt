XMB 1.10 Translation System Tips

Starting with XMB version 1.10, files named *.lang.php
have returned to the /lang/ subdirectory.  This is similar to 1.9.10
and older versions.

We still do not support UTF-8 translation, so please use other encodings.
This is planned to change in the next major version.
