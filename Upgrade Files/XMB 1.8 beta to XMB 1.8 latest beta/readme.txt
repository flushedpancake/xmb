 Use this upgrade only when upgrading a 1.8 version BEFORE: 20110207PM (released on 20th November 2002).
 If you have that, or a later, version, ignore this upgrade.
 
 If you have a lower (1.8-)version, use this upgrade. It will speed up your forum a lot!!
 
 To use this upgrade, upload all xmb 1.8 files to your forum root, excluding config.php and cinst.php.
 Then upload the upgrade.php in this folder, and run it, using your browser to go to this file.
 
 Once, finished, delete this file.
 Then log in, go into your admin Control Panel and use the Templates => Restore Templates feature to restore the templates.
