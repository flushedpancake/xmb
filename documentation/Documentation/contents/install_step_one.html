	Create a database for your forum by using either the MySQL management tool from your web site's control panel (such as phpMyAdmin) or MySQL's
	administration tool.  When creating your database, note the database name ($dbname), username ($dbuser) and password ($dbpw).  These values will be
	used later on in the installation process.
	<br /><br />

	In the following example, the MySQL command line tool will be used to create a database.  To avoid security issues your database name, user, and password
	should be different.
	<br /><br />

	<span class="code">
		mysql> CREATE DATABASE xmb198;
		<br />
		Query OK, 1 rows affected (0.03 sec)
		<br /><br />
		mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON xmb198.* TO 'xmbuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'foo123';
		<br />
		Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)
	</span>
	<br /><br />
	
	In example case above, $dbname, $dbuser, and $dbpw would be xmb198, xmbuser, and foo123, respectively.  In addition, database access has been restricted
	to the localhost, which is fine if the database server is on the same host as the web server.  If it is not, your fully qualified domain name should be put
	in place of localhost.
