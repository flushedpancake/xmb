	<span id="pageTitle">Upgrading to XMB 1.9.8 Engage</span>
	
	Upgrading is a one-way process.  To backout you will need to restore your files and database from a backup.
	<br /><br />
	
	<strong>Known Issues</strong>
	<br />
	These are known issues with the upgrader.  However, they will only affect a small percentage of XMB Forum users.
	
	<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
		<li>Upgrading can be quite resource intensive, especially with large databases.</li>
		<li>The upgrade script may appear to time out or be inactive.  Do NOT stop it or close your browser window.</li>
		<li>The upgrade script can consume up to two times the amount of disk space you are currently using.  
			Make sure your disk space quota is set accordingly.</li>
		<li>The upgrade script cannot cope with some indexes.  If the upgrader does stop while trying to drop, alter, or add an index, you will need to
			manually remove all indexes from the corresponding table.  Remove as many indexes as possible as the upgrade script will put back in place
			the one's it needs.  After manually dropping all indexes, restart the upgrader.</li>
		<li>The upgrade script occasionally fails to handle out of order columns, particularly in the settings table.  If the upgrader stops while
			modifying any table, you will need to manually change the table yourself.  Once the table is similar to the new table schema, simply
			re-start the upgrader.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<strong>Modifications Notice</strong>
	<br />
	This upgrader is designed to work with modifications installed.  However, all modification data, templates and code, will be destroyed during the
	upgrade process.  Please proceed with extreme caution if you wish to keep your modification data intact.
	<br /><br />
	
	<strong>Backup Your Forum</strong>
	<br />
	Please backup both your forums database and files before continuing.  This may seem like common sense but is often forgotten.
	If the upgrade process fails and you do not have a backup, XMB will be unable to help you.  All data could be lost: posts, users, 
	etc.  You have been warned!
	<br /><br />
