Instructions

1. Log in to your board as a Super Administrator. (Before changing anything!)

2. Disable your forums using the Board Status setting.

3. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE - This script cannot be undone!

 Did you backup everything? Including config.php? You'll need that.

4. Confirm your forum database account is granted ALTER, CREATE, INDEX, and LOCK privileges.

5. Copy your config.php settings into the new file.

6. Upload the XMB 1.10.00 files.  Do not upload the install folder (delete it if necessary).

7. Upload the upgrade directory to your board's root directory.

8. Run this script by hitting the upgrade URL, for example:  https://www.example.com/forum/upgrade/

 If you didn't follow these instructions from step 1, you will need to log in using the link provided at the upgrade URL.

9. When finished, remember to delete the upgrade directory and enable your forums using the Board Status setting.
