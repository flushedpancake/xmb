		<H2>Known bugs in 1.9.1</H2>
		<UL>
			<li>
			When a notification of a new U2U is sent via email, sometimes the email seems 
			to come from INVALID_ADDRESS@.SYNTAX-ERROR
			<LI>
			Voting in polls is impossible under certain conditions.
			<li>
			Moderators can't edit their own posts when post replies is set to 'No Posting'
			<li>
				When you create a post with no subject, the error message suggests you can go 
				back, but when you do, your post has been lost</li></UL>
		<P>These bugs will not be fixed until XMB 1.9.2.</P>
		<H3>Known problems which cannot be resolved</H3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			If you upgraded from 1.8 to 1.9.1 betas through to 1.9.1, u2u counts will be 
			wrong
			<LI>
				Double entries in tables. Eg. double whosonline entries, double member entries, 
				etc.<BR>
				To properly fix this requires transaction logging, which is not supported with 
				the current code architecture
			</LI>
		</ul>
		<p>There's nothing which can be done to fix this as the new code correctly handles 
			counting new U2U's, but the old data is incorrect and it's impossible to 
			determine which old u2u's belong to which users.</p>
