XMB 1.8 Magic How to Upgrade

 - This only works for XMB 1.6 and above.
 - Upload upgrade.php to your old directory.
 - Upload English.lang.php into your /lang folder.
 - Upload the admin folder in your images directory into /images/ (so /images/admin will be created)

     - This will drop your old templates table, create a new table and upload the templates.
     - YOU WILL LOSE ALL TEMPLATE CHANGES - HACKS ETC


 - Then copy all your old php files and lang files to an old folder called "OLD"
 - Leave config.php behind

 - Once all the files are uploaded run upgrade.php
 - Remove the files upgrade.php and cinst.php

 - If you get a blank screen rename your English.lang.php file to english.lang.php in your /lang
   directory.
