This is you're SQL database name, if you're using a control panel such as Cpanel you
need to go to SQL Databases,

This is you're SQL database username that you connect to; each database can have different
users and passwords

This is you're SQL database password which is needed to make a successful connection

$dbhost = "localhost";
The location of you're database, normally localhost or you'redomain.com

$tablepre = "xmb_";
All tables in you're database will start with xmb_  such as xmb_members etc

Ignore this option

This option can normally be left out, but if you're forum is at /mysite/forum you can change the
cookiepath to /mysite/forum

$cookiedomain = ""; // "" if you're installing locally
You must enter the information for this option, if you're site is domain.com enter .domain.com if its yahoo.com
enter .yahoo.com

If you do not enter the information, you will not be able to login or logout.


$database = "mysql";
This is the type of database to use, this option is standard.
