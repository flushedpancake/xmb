	Special Thanks  

	Special thanks go to the following people for great support of xmb throughout the years...

	RevMac, who has been giving support to xmb users for a very long time, but had to quit the team
	due to hacking attempts because of his presence on the team.

	Teresa, aka tcampos, who left for the same reasons as RevMac, but we still wish to thank for her
	great support in times past and present...

	Webster, aka Nick, who has also helped a lot by supporting the xmb users, and for his great qualities
	in maintaining the xmbhacks site for the last 6 months, we thank him. We are very sorry to see him 
	leave....

	The hackers and attackers of the xmb site, thank you for helping us to create a more secure 		product and entertaining us throughout those long nights of server monitoring ;)
	Without YOU XMB wouldn't be as good as it is today ;)
