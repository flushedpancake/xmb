----------#--- XMB README ---#----------

XMB (eXtreme Message Board) is a project of the XMB Development Team.
webfr34k began work on this script in January 2001, but eventually left XMB to move onto other thigns,
Revres Xunil was put in charge upon his leaving with WJ, and SurfiChris backing him up.
The staff has changed a few times, lang development become focused on by special language developers,
and graphics work was given to specific people. Several RC's of the 1.5 version have been recently made,
the latest begin RC5 which was the original code modified by the original authors with Javaman1 and dine,
to fix all of the known bugs. With many people leaving XMB nearly died. But it is back up with Richard and
his Aventure-Team, who are doing a good job. Some few people decided to leave XMB and to start
a new project called ReBB (Reincarnated Bulletin Board [www.ReBB.net]),
those people also brought this version out, 
which is not officialy supported by xmbforum.com...


Installation:
1. Open up config.php (Notepad will do) and find the 4 variables at the top ($dbname, $dbuser, $dbpw, $dbhost). 
   Edit these so that they match the settings for your host.
   This allows you to set a prefix for the name of each table so you can install 
   multiple instances of XMB on the same database.


2. Upload everything, retaining the original structure of the files.
   Everything thing should be in ASCII except the images/ content (binary).

3. CHMOD the cplogfile.log file to 766 or something similiar...

4. Then, run the install script.
   To do this, just visit www.yourdomain.com/boarddir/install.php.
   The script will automatically install it.

5. Go to your boards and register. It will automatically make you an admin.

6. Visit the control panel (the link will be visible once your logged in) and change stuff.
   Enjoy!

7. Don't forget to delete the newinstall.php, else other users can destroy all your tables!
