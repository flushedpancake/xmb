# Welcome to XMB

Our code moved to GitHub on 1 January 2025.

Branch 1.9.12 is the latest stable version.

The Master branch is currently unstable.  It is a future version under development.

Visit [xmbforum2.com](https://www.xmbforum2.com) for more resources.

## Getting Started (stable)

Copy the XMB files to your web server.  Keep the "install" or "upgrade" folder as needed and delete the other one.

You will need a MySQL database and connection details to get started.

## Getting Started (master branch)

Composer is required.  Install it according to the [instructions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

Create a directory for the site.  Make sure it's not owned by the root user.

Clone XMB into the current directory using `git clone https://github.com/miqrogroove/xmb.git ./`

Install the XMB dependencies using `composer install` in the same directory.

If attempting to upgrade an existing site, remember to copy any customizations of config and images (themes and smilies).

Visit the /install/ path on the website to complete the setup.

## Getting Involved

Issues, requests, discussions, and reports are all welcome here.  Note that we have a primary forum and bug tracker on our website.

If you would like to contribute or collaborate, feel free to offer ideas.  This project needs a website designer and more.
